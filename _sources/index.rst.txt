HTML to ANS
===========

This project provides a standardized method of parsing HTML elements into `ANS elements
<https://github.com/washingtonpost/ans-schema>`_. It is mainly used by Arc Publishing's
professional services team to migrate client data into the Arc platform, but can also be
used for arbitrary conversion of HTML to JSON.
