Development
===========

Getting set up
--------------

* Clone this repo
* Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed
* Ideally, set up a virtualenv and activate it (http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* From your local copy of this project, run ``pip install -rrequirements-dev.txt``
* Run tox with the command ``tox``
* If that completes successfully, you are good to go!
* Make sure you re-run tox before committing changes
